# My Website #

## Description ##
[This](https://cosmicanty.github.io/) is a website I created using html, css and javascript. I intend to expand this website so it can fully incorporate all of my python scripts and possibly even a portfolio of my works in the future.

## Function ##
At the moment, my website does have quite a bit of functionality! YAYYYYY!!!! As well as creating a sexy and cool-looking navigation bar with smooth animations, I have made the entire website completely responsive, allowing for use even on mobile devices!

Here are the current features:
* GTP-3 API
* Location API
* Quizlet Revision
* Quadratic Solver
* Prime Number Checker

More fun things are coming soon!!!

Hope you have fun!
