# Read Me #

[This](https://cosmicanty.github.io/Maths-Functions/) is a website I created using html, css and javascript. I intend to expand this website so it can fully incorporate all of my python scripts and possibly even a portfolio of my works in the future.

## Maths Functions ##
At the moment, the only functionality my website has, is a counter on the home page which you can increase or decrease by 1. 

Hope you have fun!
